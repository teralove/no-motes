# no-motes
Improve FPS by hiding mystic motes. If you are playing as mystic then your motes will be visible.

## Commands
### `nomotes [on/off]`
- Toggle on/off (Default is ON)
- Argument is optional
### `hidemotes`
### `showmotes`

## Issues
- Toggling module does not affect motes that already exist in-game (only new ones after toggle).

See config.js for options.
